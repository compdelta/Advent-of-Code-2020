# Advent of Code 2020

I decided to take part in [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020/about) this year. It's a good opportunity for JavaScript practise.

I didn't save some of the early answers, but I'm collecting what remains here, and I'll add to it regularly over the course of the challenge.
